# Analog-to-MIDI-Convert-System : Capstone Design for Electronics Engineering(2017)

A system based on MATLAB that reduce errors in MIDI files by using improved algorithm than those provided by existing Audio to MIDI converters 
-	Eliminating unnecessary harmonics that makes the MIDI result errored 
-	Extracting necessary elements to create MIDI file after eliminating harmonics 

# Patent application
-	Patent application number 10-2018-0004947
-	Title of the Invention: MIDI file generation method with harmonic elimination and audio file conversion method 
-	date of the application: 15.01.2018



# Summary
The purpose of this project is to implement enhanced midi file result than the commercially utilizing MIDI converters.
The error rate was high because the existing Audio to MIDI converter included unnecessary harmonics as output.
We devised an algorithm to remove unnecessary harmonics through a creative method called ‘Dynamic window algorithm’ and improved the accuracy of MIDI file output so that expected to get more accurate MIDI file  than the existing Audio to MIDI converter
